# RailsGo - Intelligent Navigation for Ruby on Rails Projects

RailsGo is a VS Code extension that significantly enhances code navigation in Ruby on Rails projects. With a simple "Go to Definition" action, RailsGo lets you instantly jump to the definition of:

- Models: Find the definition of any model referenced in relationships, queries, or instances.
- Controllers: Navigate directly to controllers from actions or references.
- Views & Partials: Jump to view files from render calls in different formats (HTML, JS).
- Helpers: Locate helper modules even with complex namespaces.
- Mailers: Navigate to mailer definitions from anywhere in your application.
- Services: Find service classes referenced in your code.
- Callbacks: Locate ActiveRecord callback methods.

RailsGo understands Rails structure and conventions, allowing you to navigate easily even in projects that don't strictly follow the standard structure. The extension supports complex namespaced references and intelligently searches through your project to find the right definition.

Boost your productivity by eliminating the time spent manually searching for files or navigating through your Rails project structure.
